            <h1>How to tackle cyberbulling?</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>In most cases, cyberbullies will get bored if no one is reacting to them and will move on.

Sometimes, however, they will take things to a new level and continue being abusive, even if they're banned or blocked
                    don't respond-The first step is to ignore the malicious person. Cyberbullies love the attention they get, and the more you react the more they will return to bother you.If someone's sending you hurtful email texts or posting insulting or hateful things on your blog, use any of the tools at your disposal to delete, ban, or report them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    know that your cyberbully just wants attention- Maybe you won't see the immediate, practical uses, but it's always useful to know more about the problems you face
                    <li>
                        keep evidence of the cyberbullying- In most cases, cyberbullies will get bored if no one is reacting to them and will move on.

                        Sometimes, however, they will take things to a new level and continue being abusive, even if they're banned or blocked

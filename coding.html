    <h1><u>WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF CYBERBULLYING ON PEOPLE?</u></h1>
    <p>People have almost constant access to their devices, which makes cyberbullying hard to escape. People can feel like they never get a break and thus feel the effects of cyberbullying very strongly.

        People who are cyberbullied can struggle to concentrate, which can affect how well they do at school or at work. Cyberbullying that is severe, long-lasting, or happens a lot can cause anxiety, depression, and other stress-related disorders in victims and bullies. In rare cases, people have attempted or died from suicide.</p>

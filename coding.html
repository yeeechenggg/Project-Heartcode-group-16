    <h1 class="text-center"><u>WHY IS CYBERBULLYING SO SERIOUS?</u></h1>
    <p>People have almost constant access to their devices, which makes cyberbullying hard to escape and make them feel like they never get a break. Hence, the effects of cyberbullying can be felt very strongly.</p>
    <p>Cyberbullying can also result in long-lasting emotional impacts, even after the bullying has stopped. As it is done anonymously, cyberbullying is hard to both trace and prevent. The victim also has no idea how many people have seen the derogatory messages or posts.</p>
